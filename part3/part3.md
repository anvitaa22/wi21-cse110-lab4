# Debug
What was the bug?
The bug was that the website concatenated the numbers instead of adding them.

How would you fix it?
When result is being calculated convert the type of num1 and num2 to number so that they get added and not concatenated.
The screenshot of the fix is in the directory part3 as file "fix.png"
